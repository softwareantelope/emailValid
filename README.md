# emailValid

Silex mini ap - accepts an email address and sends an encrypted link for validation

valid paths:

GET

/valid

shows a form for email entry

POST

/send

sends email with an encrypted link

Caveats

V0.0.1 	no validation, yet
	email uses swiftmailer - not yet tested
	introductory exercise in silex
	
next version:
	adapt for Laravel/Lumen
	write the link checker validator
